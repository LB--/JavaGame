# Game_Test
This is an old Java project I was working on back in my high school computer science class.
I didn't actually use git for it back then, so for the initial commit I just set the date to the last modified date of the most recently modified file.
The game was basically an attempt to clone N-Ball, but I could never quite get the collision to work the way I wanted.
